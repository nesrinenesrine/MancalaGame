# Mancala Game with Pygame

This project implements the traditional board game Mancala using Python and Pygame. The game can be played against a computer that uses alpha-beta pruning to make its decisions.

## Project Description

Mancala is a classic strategy board game played with pits and stores. This project provides a graphical interface where a human player can play against a computer. The computer uses the **NegaMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning** to determine the best moves.

## Features

- Graphical interface built with Pygame.
- Play against a computer with AI based on the NegaMax algorithm.
- Real-time visualization of scores and moves.
- Player choice (human or computer).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.

### Python Installation

You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
